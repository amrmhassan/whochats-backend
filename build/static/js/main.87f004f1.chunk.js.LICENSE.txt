//! Any room

//! IMPORTANT => this message grabber will only work when user is opening the room

//! IMPORTANT this trick is so important to use setMessages(messages=>[])

//! add here the code to log user in with his token

//! add new redux reducer for currently displayed messages

//! add this to backend too , to login with token

//! and it this component will get its messages from there

//! dispatch(loginUserAction(loggedInUser.token));

//! else if (loggedInUser && loggedInUser.token) {

//! to check if the token is expired or not

//! try applying this in the main App.jsx to login every time with userToken

//! }
