//! IMPORTANT this trick is so important to use setMessages(messages=>[])

//! add get room with id =>DONE

//! add here the code to log user in with his token

//! add this to backend too , to login with token

//! add updateDisplayedMessagesAction

//! and then update it => DONE

//! convert creating new room from redux state to react local state

//! dispatch(loginUserAction(loggedInUser.token));

//! dispatching updateMessages

//! else if (loggedInUser && loggedInUser.token) {

//! here add

//! search how to get your socket id then

//! send it to the user with emitting

//! the action will check if there is currentOpenRoom and message room is the currentOpenRoom

//! the next step is to upload the recording

//! the reducer will push the new message to the displayed messages

//! then add action to get room with id and its constant will be update room and put up => DONE

//! then the constant will be UPDATE_DISPLAYED_MESSAGES

//! then the payload will be the fetched room by action =>DONE

//! this functionality won't work now

//! to check if the token is expired or not

//! try applying this in the main App.jsx to login every time with userToken

//! width: '150px',

//! }
